# üö® Problem Statement
A FinOps-focused client managing multiple financial applications on AWS requires a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure automation framework. Manual provisioning was error-prone, inconsistent, and slow. The client needs reusable Terraform modules for backend and frontend application deployment, alongside a defined security posture including IAM hardening, VPC controls, and guardrails.
The client lacks automated, reusable infrastructure modules and a secure cloud posture for deploying both frontend (Kubernetes) and backend (EC2) workloads on AWS. Manual provisioning and inconsistent environments are leading to cost inefficiencies and security risks.

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

1. Build reusable Terraform modules for AWS infrastructure (EKS, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, etc.).

2. Implement secure deployment pipelines using CI/CD.

3. Set up logging, monitoring, and alerting.

4. Define and enforce security posture using AWS best practices.

5. Document all implementation, runbooks, and architecture in Confluence.

6. Provide demo environments (dev/staging) to validate deployments.
