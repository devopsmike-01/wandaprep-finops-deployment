# 🚨 Problem Statement
A FinOps-focused client managing multiple financial applications on AWS requires a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure automation framework. Manual provisioning was error-prone, inconsistent, and slow. The client needs reusable Terraform modules for backend and frontend application deployment, alongside a defined security posture including IAM hardening, VPC controls, and guardrails.
The client lacks automated, reusable infrastructure modules and a secure cloud posture for deploying both frontend (Kubernetes) and backend (EC2) workloads on AWS. Manual provisioning and inconsistent environments are leading to cost inefficiencies and security risks.

## ✅ Deliverables

1. Build reusable Terraform modules for AWS infrastructure (EKS, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, etc.).

2. Implement secure deployment pipelines using CI/CD.

3. Set up logging, monitoring, and alerting.

4. Define and enforce security posture using AWS best practices.

5. Document all implementation, runbooks, and architecture in Confluence.

6. Provide demo environments (dev/staging) to validate deployments.

## 🌱 Solution Architecture

Here is a high level proposed architecture blue print for the complete remediation solution:

![Wandaprep-finops-blueprint](wandaprep-finops-blueprint.png)


## 🌱 GitHub Project Branching Strategy
 
 Your github repo for the project should have this structure:

```
main            # Production-ready code
dev             # Integration branch for tested features
feature/*       # Individual feature work (e.g., feature/eks-frontend)
bugfix/*        # Bug-specific branches
hotfix/*        # Critical patches to production
release/*       # Pre-release staging

```

* Feature Branches → Merged into env branch

* Environment Branches → Merged into main for production release

* PRs require terraform plan to pass before merge

For all the environment, it should look like this

```
main
│
├── dev
│   └── feature/dev-setup-vpc
│   └── feature/dev-monitoring
│
├── staging
│   └── feature/staging-rds
│
└── prod
    └── hotfix/prod-rds-patch
```
